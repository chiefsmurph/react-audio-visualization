# react-audio-visualization

This tutorial is for creating an audio visualization in React with the web audio API.

### Let's get some stuff out of the way first,

In this tutorial will use Node.js and npm, if you already have that installed then that's great move on to the next step, otherwise [learn about // get npm here.](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

This is *not* a tutorial on how to use React. If you want to learn more about how React works check out [Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/)

The first thing we need to do is download create-react-app to get our react boilerplate. [Here are the docs if you want to learn more.](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
Type the following into your terminal:

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

### Okay now let's get started!

We can create our app by typing this command followed by the name of your application. I called mine audio-visuals in this example. Type the following into your terminal:


```
create-react-app audio-visuals
```

This may take a moment...
After it's done you can go ahead and change directories into the newly created app. Type the following into your terminal.
```
cd audio-visuals
```

Then open up the directory in your favorite text editor. \(I use Atom\) You can open it up from the terminal by typing
```
atom .
```
If you see an error that says atom is not a command then go to atom and look at the top menu bar. Click the drop down that says Atom and look for Install shell commands. Click that and you should now be able to use the atom command in your terminal.

 Now that you've opened up the directory with your text editor, take a look around! Don't worry about the node modules or anything else that looks confusing. We will walk through this step by step.  

The file structure will look like this:  
![File structure example](http://i64.tinypic.com/keao0i.png)
<!-- ```
audio-visuals/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  .gitignore
  public/
    favicon.ico
    index.html
  src/
    App.css
    App.js
    App.test.js
    index.css
    index.js
    logo.svg
``` -->
Navigate to audio-visuals/src/App.js
 you should see this in the file:

```
 import React, { Component } from 'react';
 import logo from './logo.svg';
 import './App.css';

 class App extends Component {
   render() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <div className="App-header">
           <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
           <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
         </div>
         <p className="App-intro">
           To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
         </p>
       </div>
     );
   }
 }

 export default App;
```
 You can delete some lines and leave it looking like this, or just paste the following code over it.

 ```
 import React, { Component } from 'react';
 import './App.css';

 class App extends Component {
   render() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
       </div>
     );
   }
 }

 export default App;
 ```
### Now comes the real coding :)

Now inside the div with the className App we will insert an audio tag, with whatever song you'd like. I'm going to use sublime! Also add an h2 tag to say the name of the song and artist you choose.

now the App Component should look like this:

```
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
      <h2>Sublime - 40oz to Freedom</h2>
      <audio
          ref="audio"
          autoPlay={true}
          controls={true}
          src="https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/e4a8f30ca62b4d2a129cc4df76de66f43e12fa3f?cid=null"
          >
          </audio>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

As you can see we have set a few attributes on the audio tag, including the ref attribute. This is so we can reference the tag in a method we will write on our component later on. [Learn more about the ref attribute here!](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)

You can now run ```npm start``` in your terminal and see the audio tag. Mine looks like this:  


![First website test](http://i67.tinypic.com/11t5sv8.png)  

Go back to atom or your text editor and add a canvas tag underneath the audio tag. Add a ref attribute of "analyzerCanvas" and an id of "analyzer". I've also added a couple divs with specific Ids so we can reference them later. Your app component should look like this now:

```
class App extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <div className="App">
                <h2>Sublime - 40oz to Freedom</h2>
                <div id="mp3_player">
                    <div id="audio_box">
                        <audio
                            ref="audio"
                            autoPlay={true}
                            controls={true}
                            //this is the link to my song url feel free to use it or replace it with your own
                            src={"https://p.scdn.co/mp3-preview/e4a8f30ca62b4d2a129cc4df76de66f43e12fa3f?cid=null"}
                            >
                            </audio>
                        </div>
                            <canvas
                                ref="analyzerCanvas"
                                id="analyzer"
                                >
                                </canvas>
                    </div>
                </div>
            );
        }
    }
```

Now we're going to add a method to the App component called createVisualization.
inside that method we will create a new audio context with the Web Audio API. You do not need to download anything to have access to this API. Just create a new instance by typing new AudioContext(); and save it to a variable. So far our method looks like this

```
createVisualization(){
    let context = new AudioContext();
}
```
Now that we have the Audio context object saved to a variable we can create an analyser from it with the create analyser method.
```
let analyser = context.createAnalyser();
```
Then we create a reference to the canvas element and save it to a variable. We do this by accessing the refs object that React sets up for us by typing ```this.refs```. Then we want to get the context of the canvas so we can draw shapes on it. We do this with the methods that the canvas element has available for us to use.

```
let canvas = this.refs.analyserCanvas;
let ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
```
 Now we want to grab the audio tag in the same way we did the canvas. Then we set the cross origin of the audio tag to anonymous

 ```
let audio = this.refs.audio;
audio.crossOrigin = "anonymous"
 ```
After that we pass the audio tag into the Audio context object we instantiated.

```
let audioSrc = context.createMediaElementSource(audio);
audioSrc.connect(analyser);
audioSrc.connect(context.destination);
analyser.connect(context.destination);
```
