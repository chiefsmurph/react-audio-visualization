# react-audio-visualization

This tutorial is for creating an audio visualization in React with the web audio API.

The first thing we need to do is [download create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to get our react boilerplate.

```
npm install -g create-react-app
```

Then we can create our app by typing this command followed by the name of your application. I called mine audio-visuals in this example.

```
create-react-app audio-visuals
```

This may take a moment...

Then open up the directory in your favorite text editor. \(I use Atom\)
